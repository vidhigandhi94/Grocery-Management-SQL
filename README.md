# Grocery-Management-SQL
## This project will focus on small aspect of the grocery enterprise simulating a customer buying items by selecting them on a form as if taking them from the shelves. They can then see their total and finish the transaction. 
## Using SQL I have analysed business scenarios for random data which will help the management in improving the day-to-day processes of the supermarket. Tableau is also used to visualize the findings.
